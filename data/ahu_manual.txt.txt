Air Handling Unit (AHU) Troubleshooting Guide

Problem: AHU is not supplying air after a power failure.

Steps to Reset:

1. Ensure that the main power supply to the AHU is switched ON.
2. Check the emergency stop switch; if engaged, rotate it to the RESET position.
3. Inspect the circuit breaker for any tripped conditions. If tripped, switch it back to ON.
4. Verify that the control panel display is active. If not, check the wiring connections.
5. Restart the AHU by pressing the START button on the control panel.
6. Observe the airflow for 5 minutes and ensure it is consistent.
7. If the problem persists, contact the maintenance supervisor and record the fault details.

Important Notes:
- Do not attempt repairs without authorization.
- Always wear safety gear when accessing electrical panels.
- Ensure all protective covers are secured after inspection.
